        . Before moving to Germany, I completed a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          Bachelor of Business Administration at Azerbaijan State University of
          Economics
        </span>
        , where I built a strong foundation in business, statistics and
        quantitative thinking.

      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
        Over the last years, I have worked in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">data analyst and data scientist roles</span>{" "}
        in finance and analytics companies. I&apos;ve been involved in building
        dashboards, improving reporting workflows, and developing machine
        learning models to support risk assessment, customer segmentation and
        forecasting.

        My interests sit at the intersection of{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">data analytics, econometrics and finance</span>.
        I enjoy the full workflow: from collecting and cleaning data, to modeling
        and statistical analysis, to communicating results in a clear,
        practical way to non-technical stakeholders.

      <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-slate-300">
        Outside of work and university, I&apos;m into kickboxing, strength
        training and photography. I like to treat my workspace as a small
        &quot;lab&quot; where I constantly experiment with new tools, workflows
        and projects that sharpen my skills.
